:::: {.question name="Simple Question"}

  This is a **simple** question with checklist-style answers.

  Which formula describes **normal stress**?

  - [x] $\sigma = F/A$
    - Correct! Stress is force per area.
  - [ ] $\sigma = F \cdot A$
    - This gives units of N·m², not stress.
  - [ ] $\sigma = F + A$
  - [ ] $\sigma = F - A$

  ::: correct-comment
  Well done! Stress is defined as force per unit area (Pa = N/m²).
  :::

  ::: incorrect-comment
  Think about what the unit Pa (Pascal) represents.
